Data Structures Project in C++
Overview

The Data Structures Project in C++ implements and manipulates various fundamental data structures, such as:

    Stacks (LIFO)
    Queues (FIFO)
    Binary Search Trees
    AVL Trees
    Red-Black Trees

This project is designed to consolidate knowledge in object-oriented programming, dynamic memory management, sorting, and optimization algorithms, while providing an interactive way to explore and learn these concepts.
Features

    Interactive Menu System:
        Navigate through different data structure operations.
        Perform insertions, deletions, searches, and traversals.

    Efficient Algorithms:
        Sorting and reconstruction for stacks and queues.
        Self-balancing algorithms for AVL and red-black trees.

    Performance Metrics:
        Displays the time taken for each operation.

Operations
Stacks

    Insert elements (Push)
    Remove elements (Pop)
    Display all elements
    Sort elements using various algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)

Queues

    Dequeue elements
    Display all elements
    Sort elements

Binary Search Trees (BST)

    Insert nodes
    Delete nodes
    Search for a value
    Tree traversals: In-order, Pre-order, Post-order

AVL Trees
